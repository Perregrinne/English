# English
A toy programming language with very plain-English syntax, grammar, and punctuation. I will be working on it in my free time. Mostly, I will be looking at or building on other peoples' tutorials and code repositories to figure out how to make this, but it's meant to be more of a learning project for me than a serious and original idea.
